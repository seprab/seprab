## About Me

My name is Sergio Prada, a Software Engineer at Unity Technologies. I'm working and living in Colombia. My experience has a variety of flavors because I started creating brand activation games, then I moved to the creation virtual simulators, later I worked on the creation of multi-platform applications for learning science, maths, etc, and now I'm providing professional support to the biggest customers of Unity in the Americas time zone.

I speak Spanish and English, I am an early parent, I love video games, movies, technology, challenges, outdoor activities and I plan to continue enjoying my life creating new things, enjoying my family, new technologies and nature.
