## About Me
My name is Sergio Prada, a Sr. Software Engineer at Unity Technologies. I'm working and living in Colombia. My experience spans various domains: I started with brand activation games, moved on to creating virtual simulators, then developed multi-platform educational applications, and now I provide professional support to Unity's largest customers worldwide.

I speak Spanish and English. I am a proud father, enjoy video games, movies, technology, challenges, outdoor activities, and motorcycling. I plan to continue finding joy in life with my beautiful partner and family.
