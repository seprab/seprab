Description: I'm sharing some parts of what I learn every day, either from my job or my personal projects.  I invite you to check this because I try to share particular topics that are not easily found in a single google search.

A few days ago I found what I believe is a technical blog from someone in asia. [https://blog.yucchiy.com/](https://blog.yucchiy.com/).

I believe I should follow the same steps as yucchiy because of my work, I learn a lot of things daily. 

What do I do? I work at Unity Technologies as a Software Engineer - Developer Support Engineer. In this role I'm in continuesly challenged by the customer inquiries. In order to 'assist' our requesters, we need to investigate, run tests, look for experts help, think out of the box.

I'm far to be pro, I feel like I am a regular guy trying to learn from my colleagues at Unity and customers.

Taking into consideration my role, there's a bunch a of stuff I learn in different areas, that I can easily forget given the amoun of requests we (the team where I work) get.

For example, first I work in a performance issue case, then I need to take care of asset bundles, later investigate a crash, and at the end of the day I work on a IL2CPP compilation problem. And the next day can be completly different.

So yes, I'd like to keep a personal registry of what I learn while doing my job.

I searched a bit, and decided to use [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) for mantaining my blog site. 

The plan:
- Use a github personal site for hosting the website
- User a github repository for writing the content of the website
- Make the github personal site repo a submodule of the site feeder.

Github personal site repo: [https://github.com/seprab/seprab](https://github.com/seprab/seprab)

Site feeder repo: [https://github.com/seprab/PersonalSiteFeeder](https://github.com/seprab/PersonalSiteFeeder)

So, what's the workflow?

1. Move to `PersonalSiteFeeder`
2. Create a blog entry under `content` directory with a markdown (.md) file.
3. Run `python -m pelican content`
4. Add, commit and push the changes to both repos.
